        <h1>GIT and collaborative work</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>By Andres Feipe Afanador</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Nowadays, technology has become part of our lives in ways that were previously unimaginable. We have gone from using "portable" cell phones that weighed a kilogram to having devices that weigh no more than 300 or 400 grams and have an infinite number of programs, which results in the least relevant feature of all: calls. Most of today's technology has done just that: increasingly powerful desktops and laptops, higher-definition TVs that can connect to the Internet to find all kinds of multimedia content, or modern refrigerators that can automatically do the shopping.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Even though it is something normal for us, what is behind these technologies is frequently overlooked. How are they made? Or how do they work beyond interacting with an interface? By definition of the RAE, the software is a "set of programs, instructions, and computer rules to execute certain tasks on a computer", but the programming and logic are often unknown. And it is not unusual for this to be so, since the lack of knowledge about new technological advances is immense, that the operation of many of them is a complete mystery to the point of not being able to interact properly with the devices themselves. Starting with adults, who usually have a complete lack of knowledge about the functioning of the technological elements they use daily, going through people who are not interested at all in how the filters they use when taking a picture with their cell phone work. All this is part of the misinformation that has been generated due to the lack of visibility that these issues may have.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Regardless of its nature, a software's creation usually involves different numbers of people trying to make an indie game or creating and maintaining the operating system that people use every time they slide their friends' Instagram stories. At the same time, getting everyone involved in writing hundreds of lines of code to come up with a result where there are no bugs, performance issues, or delivery delays is seemingly impossible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Here is where DVCS, distributed version control systems, come in. They are responsible for the software's implementation, where hundreds of developers are involved. The DVCS is a type of version control where the developer's changes get saved for all team members; these ensure that everyone involved is aware of every change and can consider them to implement them in their code or return to a previous version.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          One of these tools is Git, a free system implemented by different platforms like GitHub and GitLab. All in one, version control and a cloud repository that you can access from any device, a vital part of the GIT system. However, this is not the only benefit you can obtain when you implement it; when we are talking about collaborative work, it provides flexibility that gives us having all this information in a central repository.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The flexibility is one of the strengths of GIT, with two essential features. The first is the possibility of working simultaneously on the same project, thanks to the Branch; this allows us to have a snapshot of the project and work on it in a controlled and isolated way. Also, we can get its different versions and join them to the project or higher Branch safely. As well, verifies the integrity of the changes we are adding and allows us to modify them before the integration. In large workgroups is complicated to organize meetings where everyone is present and can report their changes. Version control, the second functionality, is centralized on these protocols; this is essential in collaborative work, especially in software, where code's line can be the difference between a functional application or a few hundred errors. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The possibility to return to any previous point is the most valuable benefit. This service will help you fix bugs and recover deleted code or fully functional versions. It is a lifesaver that all developers need someday.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          For this reason, the use of GIT or a DVCS is handy in the development of every application's software for the Play or Apple Store and the store itself. In general, all present and future operating systems developed by companies, developers, or studios will need these features for an agile, secure, and clean development. But this tool is not the only one and, although I detail its main features, it is not the only one. Many more options will be helpful when we are coding.  The programming languages have been evolving, adapting, and growing to offer better features, simpler and faster to use, also frameworks allow us to simplify processes or show us the best way to implement entire blocks of code. Also the tools that are booming as Low Code pages, which allow the creation of entire programs, web pages or video games with methods such as Drag and Drop.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          All this is an unexplored world for most of the users because they only use the final product, without thinking about all the work behind and all the tools that are necessary to create. For example the Facebook that you are seeing or its reactions; also all the technologies and protocols that are behind a video call. It is to these teams and their work that millions of people can enjoy the technological advances of today, and with these same tools will continue to be created to further facilitate the creation of these, always seeking not only the ease for the user but also the ease of their programmers.
